# =============================================================================
# Brewfile.media-server - Minimal packages for media server
# =============================================================================
# Lightweight setup for remote access and basic management
# Plex and other media apps are installed separately

# Note: This extends the base Brewfile which includes:
# - Shell tools (zsh, tmux, oh-my-posh)
# - Modern CLI tools (bat, eza, fzf, etc.)
# - Ghostty terminal

# No additional packages needed - base Brewfile covers essentials
# Add media-server specific tools here if needed in the future
